# wuhan6-phylodynamics
The age of insect virus phylodynamics, now

Figures:

1. Timeline of discovery - publications, (number of sequences?), number of segments + genome organisation figure.
2. Map + tree - nextstrain style, reassortment network with map indicating samples and hypotheses of spread.
3. Selection - undecided yet, but analyses will include per site and whole protein dN/dS estimates. Comparison with gp64 structures in case there's per site positive selection.

Supplementary figures:

- Culex phylogeny with Wuhan 6 distribution highlighted.
